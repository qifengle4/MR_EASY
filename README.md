This package provides a set of custom functions for conducting Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis, including process_gwas_data, perform_mr_analysis, and perform_re_mr_analysis. It primarily achieves this by processing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. The code focuses on two main functionalities: data preprocessing and MR analysis.
